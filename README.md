## Installation
It is advised to use virtual environment to install the files. Virtual environment can be created using anaconda. See [this](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html) to install conda into your system.  
Once you have conda in your system you can use it to create virtual environment.
```bash
conda create -n name_of_the_env python=3
```
You can activate/deactivate the virtual enviroment
```bash
conda activate name_of_the_env
conda deactivate
```
Once you have activated your virtual environment go to the folder where you kept the cloned files. To install the folder type in the terminal
```bash
pip install .
```
Once installed, files can be changed and run in python.
